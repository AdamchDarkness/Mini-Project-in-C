# Mini-Project-on-C
This is my mini-project that I did in my first year of my development school. It was entirely made by me and made in C language. It contains several structures (loops, conditions, files). This is a mini application that has several interfaces 1- admin interface (the code is 545 but don't tell anyone). 2-manager interface (the manager account is created by the admin). 3-user interface (to create a user account type 0). I do not spoil you all the options available, the code is fully detailed in French with comments (if you ever want an English version tell me).
